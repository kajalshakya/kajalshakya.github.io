<p> London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[8][9] The city stands on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[11][12][13][14][15][note 1] The adjacent City of Westminster is an Inner London borough and has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. London is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.[16][note 2][17]</p>
